<h1>Mobile</h2>
<h2>Solutions that go where your users go</h2>
<p>Solutions that go where your users go In today’s wireless environment, businesses have the unique ability to reach their users wherever they live, work, or play. Retailers can accept payments on-the-fly through a tablet or smartphone; shipping and logistics companies can track their fleet vehicles through LBS solutions; and media providers can stream audio and video through mobile apps. The rapid development of mobile technology – and its growing integration with the cloud– creates new opportunities for both consumers and enterprises that were unimaginable only a few years ago. This evolution also means that solution providers must constantly update their technology to stay relevant in this extremely competitive market

<h1>Cloud</h1>
<h2>Content and services without boundaries</h2>
<p>From online banking and remote patient monitoring solutions to on-demand entertainment and

communications platforms, the cloud has become an integral part of how businesses deliver content

and services. Cloud technologies–especially combined with sensors and mobile devices–enable an

increasingly larger and more widely distributed user base to access real-time solutions anytime,

anywhere.

As consumer and business environments become more global and their users more mobile, software

systems must become more interconnected than ever. To meet user expectations and needs, cloud

systems must be elastically scalable, provide fast and uninterrupted performance, and protect large

volumes of confidential information.
</p>


<h2>How Synclovis helps</h2>
<p>Synclovis collaborates with businesses across industry segments to architect, develop, and deploy

secure, scalable, cloud-based products and solutions. We empower our customers to deliver cutting- edge products, from architecting and designing entertainment systems scalable to hundreds of millions

of users, to developing and deploying cloud emergency medical systems that literally save lives.

Synclovis understands that “cloud” is not a new name for SaaS or virtualization, but a new computing

paradigm. The ability to dynamically create, destroy, and configure inexpensive compute resources

“elastically” and on-demand provides new business capabilities and rewards a new approach to

software architecture.

Our deep mobile expertise, as well as our “machine to machine” (M2M) and Big Data analytics skills,

complement our cloud capabilities. Our cloud technology competency and cross-industry expertise

enables us to successfully design and develop cloud-based solutions where performance, scalability and

security are critical.
